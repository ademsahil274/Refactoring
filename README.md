# Refactoring-Horiseon

## User Story
AS A marketing agency <br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards <br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines <br>

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards <br>
WHEN I view the source code <br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements <br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements <br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning <br>
WHEN I view the image elements <br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes <br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes <br>
THEN they fall in sequential order <br>
WHEN I view the title element <br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title <br>

## HTML changes I made:
* Added web page title at the head. <br>
* Added alt attributes to images to improve SEO. <br>
* Added comments to index.html and style.css to facilitate refactoring. <br>
* Changed a "div" class to "section" class elemant. <br>
* Changed a "div" to semantic element "footer". <br>
